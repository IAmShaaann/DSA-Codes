Hey There. 🎭

I've been going through #designpatterns lately and was studying about Strategy Design Pattern. What did i learn? 💻

🔍 The Strategy pattern allows us to encapsulate algorithms as interchangeable strategies, making our code more maintainable, extensible, and reusable. It promotes a modular architecture that separates behaviors, enabling us to switch between strategies effortlessly. 🔄

Here is a great example for the same. 🧵

In this example, we have a family of ducks with different behaviors. Some ducks can fly long distances, some quack loudly, while others may even dance. 🌟

Instead of hardcoding these behaviors within each duck subclass, the Strategy pattern suggests encapsulating them as separate strategies. Each behavior becomes a strategy that can be dynamically assigned to any duck at runtime. 🔄

This design approach allows us to mix and match behaviors, making our duck objects highly flexible and adaptable. We can easily swap or add new behaviors without modifying existing duck classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability. 💪🦆
